			<div>	Born in Seattle, Washington, Cori crew up hiking and cross-country skiing. Her current love of programming was preceeded by loves of violin, acting, and crew, among other. She cultivated her propensity for running late at an early age when she lived less than a block away from her local public elementary school and got used to leaving the house 10 minutes before school started. This was also where she began her career as a trouble-maker.
			She graduated and was forced to learn to wake up earlier for school as she had to walk around a mile to school with her best friend, who lived two blocks away. She moved on from being a complete tomboy. She also switched to playing the french horn, because the band got to play the tequila song and seemed much more fun, and continued her propensity for being a "distruption to herself and others".

				Eventually she moved on to high school after a summer exchange visit with her middle school's sister school in Japan. There she had to adjust to the drastic change of private school, which kept her too busy to fully indulge her trouble-making tendencies. There she become engrossed in the cult of crew, fell in love with organic chemistry, learned she enjoyed model United Nations, began to drive, was just introduced to computer science, and applied, and got accepted, to college.

				Going to Tufts University, she shocked herself by continuing on in crew. After a freshman year of meeting new people and making new friends, she decided she needed to rediscover her mischevious streak as well as get involved in more. In pursuit of these objectives, she has enjoyed many adventures and new activies. 
				Cori hopes to study abroad and graduate Tufts. She then intends to get hired and, eventually, move back to Seattle.
